/**
 * <p>This is similar to the datastore Query object, but better understands
 * real class objects - it allows you to filter and sort by the key field
 * normally.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The methods of this class follow the GAE/Python Query class rather than
 * the GAE/Java Query class because the Python version is much more convenient
 * to use.  The Java version seems to have been designed for machines, not
 * humans.  You will appreciate the improvement.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Construct this class by calling {@code Objectify.query()}</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that this class is Iterable itself; you do not need to call the
 * fetch() method, but it is available if you like it.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To obtain a {@code Cursor} call {@code Query.iterator().getCursor()}.
 * This cursor can be resumed with {@code Query.cursor()}.</p>
